    <h1>Document Guidelines</h1>

    <p> This document describes several rules the programmer is recommended to
    stick to, in order to produce code, which is readable and extendable and
    that fits with the other sources of the project. If you don't stick to them
    we can't do anything about it, but try to do so. </p>


    <h2>Text Files<a name="textfiles"></a></h2>

    <p> Try to start each text file with a descriptive header that shows the
    title, CVS revision number, and information on the last change (author,
    date) </p>

    <pre>
    [b12] <i>title</i> &#8212; &#36;Revision&#36;
          last change: &#36;Author&#36; &#8212; &#36;Date&#36;
    </pre>

    <p> In general break the line at character 80 and try not to insert any
    TABs. Try to create text files that are easily readable. </p>


    <h2>HTML files</h2>
    TODO write constraints for HTML documents.



    <h2>Source Files (.java)</h2>

    <p>The standard header for a source file contains a short information about the
    filename, creation date and the CVS revision number. It should look like
    this:</p>

    <pre>
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    // [b12] Java Source File: <i>filename</i>.java
    //                created: dd.MM.yyyy
    //              &#36;Revision&#36;
    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    </pre>

    <p> The revision field is updated automatically by the revision control
    system.</p>


    <h3>Limits</h3>

    <p> In order to obtain useful and manageable sources there are some limits.
    If something does not abide to these constraints try to refactor the
    type/method.</p>

    <ul>

        <li>The line length is limited to 80 characters (see
        <a href="#textfiles">Text Files</a> in general)</li>

        <li>A source file should at most hold 1500 lines.</li>

        <li>A method should at most hold 75 lines.</li>

        <li>A type should at most consist of 700 lines.</li>

    </ul>


    <h3>Comments</h3>

    
<p>Javadoc for all types and public and protected methods and fields is obligatory. 
  Try to be as descriptive as possible. In-line comments are also very useful 
  so please exercise this option for others who have a look at your code and for 
  yourself. If you look at your badly documented code the morning after a long 
  coding night, you might not understand everything.</p>
